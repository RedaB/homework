Heroes Of Pymoli Data Analysis

This was give:

Of the 1163 active players, the vast majority are male (84%). There also exists, a smaller, but notable proportion of female players (14%).

Our peak age demographic falls between 20-24 (44.8%) with secondary groups falling between 15-19 (18.60%) and 25-29 (13.4%).

These are my observations:

Although our peak total purchase count falls between 20-24 ($1,114.06) with secondary groups falling between 15-19 (%412.89), the average total purchase per person is still close between $3 and $5.

Oathbreaker seems to be the most popular game with 12 purachse counts and generating the highest total putrache value.

With almost equal average purchase price and average total purchases person values, male players seem to be the top spenders with approximatley 82% of over all total purchase.
